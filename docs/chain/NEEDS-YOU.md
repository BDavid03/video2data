# Needs the owner

Things only the owner can do. Chain contexts add to this list and keep working on everything
else. To grant one, add a dated line to `AGENTS.md` (for example "2026-11-02: push approved").
Every context reads `AGENTS.md` first, so the next context acts on it. Then tick the item here.

## Open

1. [ ] **GitHub remote (D4).** Both packed files must carry a `.../commit/<sha>` URL. The
   checkout became a local git repository on 2026-11-01. Create a GitHub repository (the
   challenge requires Apache-2.0 release for a winning entry), add it as `origin` and push, or
   say the chain may do it. Until then, packed files use the local commit and are marked not
   final.
2. [ ] **Kaggle upload (D6).** When a context has packed the files, it writes the exact
   commands here. Before uploading: export a token from <https://kaggle.com/settings/api> as
   `KAGGLE_API_TOKEN` (a legacy `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` does not work with kaggle>=2), and
   accept the rules on all six Track 3 competitions (five pose, one CD-O). There is no API for
   accepting rules.
3. [ ] **`coursework/` material** lost on 2026-10-29 (Week 1-12 notebooks, `data/`,
   `glove.6B.100d.txt`, `make_coursework.py`, `helper_funcs/`), if another copy exists. Only the
   hashed subset that `scratch_depth` needs is present. Not needed for the submission.
